The people that are curated are brilliant, smart, talented, and giving. HATCH is beyond a doubt the best thing I have ever experienced. It’s changed how I do business — and how I live life.”</p>

  				<h3>360&deg; Mentorship</h3>
  				<p>Mentoring is a Hatch cornerstone. HATCH is built around meaningful relationships. What began as top-down mentorship has evolved into a ‘360’ mentorship approach; bottom-up and peer to peer. We encourage — if not expect — all HATCH community members to mentor, share, and challenge one another. &nbsp;<a href="/mentorship/360-mentorship">Learn more about 360° Mentorships</a></p>

  			<p><strong>Big Sky, MT</strong> — Consistently named one of the best towns in America by publications such as Outdoor Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, New York Times, Forbes, and more. Big Sky is an epicenter of creativity and innovation, and home to Montana State University. The area is a destination for some of the world’s most coveted fly-fishing, and was the central location for “A River Runs Through It.” Southwest Montana is a cultural and scenic oasis, and is only an hour outside of the stunning Yellowstone Park. Within the last decade, Montana has also become a place where innovators like Bill Gates, Justin Timberlake, Peter Chernin, and Larry Ellison converge to re-calibrate on how they are impacting the world.</p>
