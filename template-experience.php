  				<h3>360&deg; Mentorship</h3>
  				<p>Mentoring is a Hatch cornerstone. HATCH is built around meaningful relationships. What began as top-down mentorship has evolved into a ‘360’ mentorship approach; bottom-up and peer to peer. We encourage — if not expect — all HATCH community members to mentor, share, and challenge one another. &nbsp;<a href="#">Learn more about 360° Mentorships</a></p>

  					<p>“What became instantly clear at HATCH is that the state of my health, our community’s health, and the world's health, are all directly proportional to the degree to which creativity is truly empowered in the world. Creativity is the catalyst that will solve worlds toughest problems. It’s the engine that drives advancement in the sciences. It gives our life meaning. Its a common thread in our humanity, and it seeds the answers to tomorrows prayers. And thats why anything that can empower that faculty in us in such a powerful way is a game changer. And thats why I'm thankful I was invited to - and impacted by Hatch. But I also plan to remember, Hatch is not a noun. Hatch is a verb.”</p>

  			<p><strong>BOZEMAN, MT</strong> — Consistently named one of the best towns in America by publications such as Outdoor Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, New York Times, Forbes, and more. Bozeman is an epicenter of creativity and innovation, and home to Montana State University. The area is a destination for some of the world’s most coveted fly-fishing, and was the central location for “A River Runs Through It.” Southwest Montana is a cultural and scenic oasis, and is only an hour outside of the stunning Yellowstone Park. Within the last decade, Montana has also become a place where innovators like Bill Gates, Justin Timberlake, Peter Chernin, and Larry Ellison converge to re-calibrate on how they are impacting the world.</p>
